<PRE>&gt;<i> As you can see in the document I've listed a number of restraints we
</I>&gt;<i> found Jigdo currently has, and I would like to help get these issues
</I>&gt;<i> resolved upstream as much as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We found that Jigdo currently is unable to thread a number of requests
</I>&gt;<i> in parallel so that it -if it did- makes optimal use of the available
</I>&gt;<i> resources in case the bandwidth availability between the client and a
</I>&gt;<i> mirror is sufficient; as many files are actually small files currently
</I>&gt;<i> we find that obtaining the files one after another takes rather long. We
</I>&gt;<i> would love to investigate how we could optimize this by threading.
</I>
I came across this post
<A HREF="http://bmvbab.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_archive.html">http://bmvbab.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_archive.html</A> which suggests
using aria2 instead of wget for downloads.

I haven't tried it and I don't know how well it works. I do know aria2
is a great downloader and can do multi-source downloads and parallel
downloads.

I also found this request to integrate jigdo &amp; metalink:
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=3793&amp;group_id=694">http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=3793&amp;group_id=694</A>

metalinks are an XML list of files used by download apps.

.jigdo &amp; .metalink files both contain a lot of the same info, like
mirrors &amp; checksums. the jigdo file has some information that
metalinks don't, like the image/template file which I believe has the
boot info of an ISO.
metalinks can contain some info that .jigdo doesn't, like chunk
checksums (for download repair, nice for large files).

the .metalink will be more verbose/larger, but can be compressed in
transfer. the .metalink can also be used by a lot of standard download
apps.

&gt;<i> - While the Fedora Project uses &quot;MirrorManager&quot; to direct clients to a
</I>&gt;<i> (list of) local mirrors, we would like Jigdo to be able to 'cache' the
</I>&gt;<i> mirror list returned by MirrorManager and use these mirrors constantly,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of hitting the mirrorlist for each request (e.g. each file). Not
</I>&gt;<i> being able to do so, we fear, results in overloading MirrorManager as
</I>&gt;<i> per ISO image, approximately 4000 requests would have to be made.
</I>
MirrorManager has planned support for generating .metalinks for ISO files.
