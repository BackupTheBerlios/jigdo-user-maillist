In that case it's likely you do not have another sh installed...
For the moment, I'm at a loss why the &quot;sh&quot; binary is crashing for you. :-/ 
Do you use Windows Vista?

Most probably, that .tmp file doesn't actually contain a lot of data yet - 
jigdo creates it with its final size first and then slowly fills it up with 
the data that is downloaded. Thus, you won't lose a lot of downloaded data 
if you delete it.

Hmm... so unless you can find further clues about the source of the problem 
yourself, I can only say: Don't use jigdo. :-/ Instead, I recommend you 
download a small network install CD image from 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/</A>&gt; and then download the remaining 
packages during the installation procedure. Note that this requires that 
the computer you are running the installer on has network access.

Cheers,

  Richard
