&gt;<i> That's strange - the &quot;sh&quot; binary seems to be crashing. :-/
</I>&gt;<i> How did you run jigdo-lite - did you try double-clicking the .bat 
</I>&gt;<i> file? Do you have any other &quot;sh&quot; program installed, e.g. as part of a 
</I>&gt;<i> Cygwin installation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>

Dear Richard,
Thanks for your response. I tried it many times getting almost the same 
results. I am not sure what other programs I might have (in fact I dont 
even know what sh or cygwin are) but I have installed gaim, rainlendar 2 
and may be some other programs which were written for linux and later 
for windows i guess. But they were already there when jigdo arrived in 
my laptop :-)
Anyway I tried it again just now and got the following, please see the 
later part of it:

The temporary directory

already exists. Its contents
ARE GOING TO BE DELETED (possibly after having been copied to the

to happen, press Ctrl-C now. Otherwise, press Return to proceed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you already have a previous version of the CD you are
downloading, jigdo can re-use files on the old CD that are also
present in the new image, and you do not need to download them
again. Enter the path to the old CD ROM's contents (e.g. `d:\').
Alternatively, just press enter if you want to start downloading
the remaining files.

You can also enter a single digit from the list below to
select the respective entry for scanning:

My major concern is the 4.3 GB .tmp that I have downloaded, is there 
anyway I can save that? I mean can I download small remaining parts?
I can re-download the jidgo if you advise so.
Thanks and hope to hear from you,
Regards,
Faisal
