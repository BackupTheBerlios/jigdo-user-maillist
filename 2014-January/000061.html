It depends if the filesystems on these CDs are compressed.
JigDo builds ISOs from chunks of raw data and is unaware
of the filesystem it's building. If the CD uses, say,
squashfs, JigDo can't figure out what to write to the ISO
to get a certain file upon decompression.

That said, some installation media (which usually can be
easily generated with JigDo) can act as LiveCDs as well.

IIRC, there was a discussion about hybrid LiveCD/USB images
involving JigDo support for xorriso on debian-cd mailing
list, but I can't recall if it was relevant.

If it is possible to create a compressed LiveCD with JigDo,
it probably involves generating decompressed filesystem
with JigDo, compressing it, and using that as a chunk file
for JigDo-assembled ISO. I doubt there's any support for that.
One problem I see is that the compressed filesystem
may not be byte-for-byte identical with a filesystem
containing the same data, but compressed with a different
version of the compressor, or (if metadata is held
within the compressed filesystem) at different time.

If JigDo had support for generating chunks from
arbitrary scripts and disregarding them in checksum
calculation, this could be possible, IMO.
