You probably only need to host the source code for your project.  If you
are distributing a modified FUSE library or Jigsaw binaries then you
need to provide source for those, but I don't think you should need
either of those to be modified for what you are doing.

You should try verifying the checksums for the reassembled ISOs.  I
tried creating a reassembly program almost two years ago now and wasn't
able to get them to match, users will expect these to check out.  I
believe the ISO file is still valid though.  You can find the
documentation of my problem in the August 2008 mailing list archive.  My
implementation is here at line 1137, mkiso():

<A HREF="http://metalinks.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/metalinks/checker/metalink.py?view=markup">http://metalinks.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/metalinks/checker/metalink.py?view=markup</A>

&gt;<i> You are the second to know about it (my friend was first) and I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to know your opinion. I may also need help in the future
</I>&gt;<i> (ie. I could not find any specification of template files - I figured it
</I>&gt;<i> out myself, so JigdoFUSE may be incompatible with untested images).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This is the closest you get to a specification:

<A HREF="http://atterer.net/jigdo/debian-jigdo-mini-howto/x157.html">http://atterer.net/jigdo/debian-jigdo-mini-howto/x157.html</A>

The Jigdo tools seem to do more than what is described here.  For this
reason I would not recommend spending a lot of time trying to figure
things out.  You will quickly get into doing a binary diff on large .iso
files.

&gt;<i> Thank you in advance for replying (It is quite quiet around here).
</I>&gt;<i> Any critique welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, almost forgot; a quick temporary draft of project site with sources:
