That's right. I use them unmodified. Thank you.

</I> 
As I said: It works. Images are generated properly. A cmp against
original image runs for couple of minutes (will improve in future) and
finally returns with no errors. MD5 sums also match. Well, they must
because files are identical.

As for your problem: Well, I wish I knew Python... My friend
(mentioned earlier) states that a programmer doesn't need to know Python
in order to be able to read it. Unfortunately it's not true for me,
because Python has some magic I am unfamiliar with. As far as I
understand your code you read 1MiB blocks of data (lines 1098 and
1123; and yes, I've read more than 30 lines of code to get it) from
template file and compare its beginning with a set of type strings and
add uncompressed data to a buffer if you encounter &quot;BZIP&quot; or
&quot;DATA&quot; (which I am missing in JigdoFUSE, because I've never seen it
before). You completely ignore the &quot;DESC&quot; section, which describes the
template file and it is where you should start to parse the template.
I think your problem is caused by the fact you read data in fixed size
blocks. &quot;BZIP&quot; entries are not always 1MiB long, so you probably
extract only the first of them and the rest gets ignored as you try to
compare with type strings somewhere in the middle of them.

&gt;<i> &gt; You are the second to know about it (my friend was first) and I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like to know your opinion. I may also need help in the future
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (ie. I could not find any specification of template files - I figured it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out myself, so JigdoFUSE may be incompatible with untested images).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the closest you get to a specification:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://atterer.net/jigdo/debian-jigdo-mini-howto/x157.html">http://atterer.net/jigdo/debian-jigdo-mini-howto/x157.html</A>
</I>
If this is the most detailed description of template file that can be
found it does not meet my definition of specification. It is more an
overview on what jigdo does when it resembles the file rather then a
description of template file itself. I think I will publish my version,
as it is far more detailed, but I will need to &quot;dress it up&quot; a bit,
because I've been writing it for myself. This may help you to cope with
your problem.

&gt;<i> The Jigdo tools seem to do more than what is described here.  For this
</I>&gt;<i> reason I would not recommend spending a lot of time trying to figure
</I>&gt;<i> things out.  You will quickly get into doing a binary diff on large .iso
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I> 
In fact it took me a week or so of &quot;from time to time&quot; work (digging
through the hexdumps of various template files and sometimes reading
the source of jigdo; `jigdo-file list-template` was also useful). I am
pretty sure I did it quite right, because it works ;-).


Thank you for replying. I was afraid the jigdo-user list was dead.
Now I know that there is someone here ;-).

Still sorry for my poor English,
and for replying with great delay. I'm GMT+1+1 (Poland, summer time).
