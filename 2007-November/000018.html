<PRE>Hi,

you're talking about submitting patches - against jigdo-lite? Or are you 
planning to continue work on the GUI?? The latter would be extremely cool. 
The former might produce results quicker, but let me warn you that shell 
programming is not fun, especially if you want to support at least a 
handful of different shell implementations under various OSes. :)

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> LabelA=<A HREF="http://mirrorlist.org/myworld">http://mirrorlist.org/myworld</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> while jigdo-lite or the GUI actually uses:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Servers]
</I>&gt;<i> LabelA=<A HREF="http://nl1.mirror.org/packages">http://nl1.mirror.org/packages</A> (from 'mycountry')

</I>&gt;<i> LabelA=<A HREF="http://de1.mirror.org/packages">http://de1.mirror.org/packages</A> (from 'myworld')
</I>&gt;<i> LabelA=<A HREF="http://us1.mirror.org/packages">http://us1.mirror.org/packages</A> (from 'myworld')
</I>&gt;<i> LabelA=<A HREF="http://mymirror.org/packages">http://mymirror.org/packages</A>
</I>
Should entries in [MirrorList] behave more or less like jigdo-lite 
currently does for the special-case label name &quot;Debian&quot;? With &quot;Debian&quot;, it 
prompts you to select one mirror from the list of Debian mirrors (which is 
supplied with jigdo-lite - I know, it's a bit of a hack!)

Actually, for the GUI I was thinking of the following syntax:
[Servers]
LabelA=<A HREF="http://nl1.mirror.org/packages">http://nl1.mirror.org/packages</A> --priority=2
LabelA=<A HREF="http://de1.mirror.org/packages">http://de1.mirror.org/packages</A> --priority=2
LabelA=<A HREF="http://mymirror.org/packages">http://mymirror.org/packages</A> --priority=1

i.e. the first two mirrors would be interpreted as equal, preferred sources 
- the user should be asked or the best server picked automatically. Only if 
a file cannot be found on the first set of mirrors, lower-priority mirrors 
will be used.

For Debian, there is actually a valid use case for three levels of mirrors; 
snapshot.debian.net contains copies of many many old Debian package 
versions, but should not be used unless really necessary (--priority=0), 
because of bandwidth limitations.

[I'm sure I wrote down all my planned extensions to the .jigdo format 
somewhere, but I can't find the file right now. :-/ ]

&gt;<i> [...snip...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The way this was envisioned by me for the jigdo GUI client (and it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already implemented there!) was to have people add an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;[Include <A HREF="http://example.org/mirrormgr.php">http://example.org/mirrormgr.php</A>]&quot; line inside the .jigdo file. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably we could already make full use of this or similar eliminating 
</I>&gt;<i> any need for the above mentioned mirrorlist/server, if only we could 
</I>&gt;<i> specify a label for the include -which is primarily of concern when 
</I>&gt;<i> having multiple images in one .jigdo. Besides, Fedora MirrorManager 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have 'weighted' mirrors.
</I>
Ah, OK - so you mean, what is included is just a list of URLs, and you want 
those URLs to be associated with a label?
Hmm, the easy solution would be: Preprocess the mirror list on the server 
side, adding a [Servers] line and a &quot;LabelA=&quot; prefix. ;-)
Otherwise, your proposed syntax is OK, or alternatively something like the 
following:

[Servers]
LabelA=<A HREF="http://mirrorlist.org/mycountry">http://mirrorlist.org/mycountry</A> --url-list

Actually, after thinking about it for a while, I cannot find any real 
reason why this should be better than your proposed syntax. I'd somehow 
prefer it, but yours is also fine, it's up to you! :)

[jigdo GUI code]
&gt;<i> &gt; Anyone who starts work on it (including me) will need a while to find 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their way around.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As do I (have been browsing the code for a while now looking for the best 
</I>&gt;<i> way to change anything so that I can see the effects and learn what it is 
</I>&gt;<i> the code does exactly) ;-)
</I>
Have you read the stuff towards the end of doc/Hacking.txt? There is a 
little high-level explanation of the different parts of the code.

Cheers,

  Richard
