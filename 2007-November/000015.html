<PRE>Hello all,

I am the owner of a proposed feature for Fedora 9, which is to have 
Fedora 9 released via Jigdo.

More information on the proposed feature can be obtained from:

<A HREF="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/JigdoRelease">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/JigdoRelease</A>

Note that this proposal is not mutually exclusive with current 
distribution methods in use by the Fedora Project[1] -BitTorrent and 
full ISO images being mirrored.

As you can see in the document I've listed a number of restraints we 
found Jigdo currently has, and I would like to help get these issues 
resolved upstream as much as possible.

Also note that the mentioning of pyJigdo in the document is Fedora 
Unity's[2] (not the official Fedora Project) 'quick and dirty' 
work-around for batch-processing and mirroring slices amongst a limited 
number of private mirrors. It is most definitely not targeted to be a 
replacement in any way; in fact it merely invokes jigdo-lite any given 
number of times.

As I said I was hoping to be able to resolve the issues we've found with 
using Jigdo for releases of spins of Fedora (be it Fedora Unity Re-Spins 
or the actual official Fedora Project Releases) with you, and in 
upstream Jigdo.

So what are the issues at this moment? Let me emphasize that we may not 
be using Jigdo the correct way; there may be a number of settings or 
tweaks available that I don't know of.

- We found that Jigdo currently is unable to thread a number of requests 
in parallel so that it -if it did- makes optimal use of the available 
resources in case the bandwidth availability between the client and a 
mirror is sufficient; as many files are actually small files currently 
we find that obtaining the files one after another takes rather long. We 
would love to investigate how we could optimize this by threading.

- While the Fedora Project uses &quot;MirrorManager&quot; to direct clients to a 
(list of) local mirrors, we would like Jigdo to be able to 'cache' the 
mirror list returned by MirrorManager and use these mirrors constantly, 
instead of hitting the mirrorlist for each request (e.g. each file). Not 
being able to do so, we fear, results in overloading MirrorManager as 
per ISO image, approximately 4000 requests would have to be made.

- When files contain a '+' character (such as gcc-c++.rpm), in 
combination with our MirrorManager, jigdo-lite will not be able to 
actually achieve the file. This may be a MirrorManager bug and have 
nothing to do with jigdo-lite not being able to retrieve the file, but I 
thought I'd mention it as right now we just manually replace each '+' in 
the .jigdo for '%2b' and things start to work.

- The Jigdo GUI client. Well, we could certainly help out here.

Other then these issues which we expect might be relevant to big 
releases such as official Fedora Project Releases, let me tell you that 
Fedora Unity (again, not the same ;p), has successfully released a 
number of custom spins via Jigdo[3], and is very, very satisfied with 
the results ;-)

If you don't mind please let me know what you think, I'm very interested 
in any comments (on the 'issues' or 'concerns' presented as well as the 
Proposed Feature document).

Thank you in advance,

Kind regards,

Jeroen van Meeuwen
