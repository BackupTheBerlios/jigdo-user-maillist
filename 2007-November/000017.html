Thank you for taking the time with us ;-)

I would like to present you at first with two patches:

1) Make use of a [mirrorlist] section before [servers] is being parsed.

This way (walking over the items in the [mirrorlist] section, we can 
extend, or build, the [servers] section in a way that we like; making 
full use of our mirrors; It'd just require a list of mirrors to be 
served at any given location, and it would be prepended to the list of 
servers. This means the mirrorlist is being 'cached' (or actually just 
generated once and used further on). It would look like the following

[Servers]
LabelA=<A HREF="http://mymirror.org/packages">http://mymirror.org/packages</A>

[MirrorList]
LabelA=<A HREF="http://mirrorlist.org/mycountry">http://mirrorlist.org/mycountry</A>
LabelA=<A HREF="http://mirrorlist.org/myworld">http://mirrorlist.org/myworld</A>

while jigdo-lite or the GUI actually uses:

[Servers]
LabelA=<A HREF="http://nl1.mirror.org/packages">http://nl1.mirror.org/packages</A> (from 'mycountry')
LabelA=<A HREF="http://nl1.mirror.org/packages">http://nl1.mirror.org/packages</A> (from 'mycountry')
LabelA=<A HREF="http://de1.mirror.org/packages">http://de1.mirror.org/packages</A> (from 'myworld')
LabelA=<A HREF="http://us1.mirror.org/packages">http://us1.mirror.org/packages</A> (from 'myworld')
LabelA=<A HREF="http://mymirror.org/packages">http://mymirror.org/packages</A>

and 2) Allow some kind of dialog to select multiple images to be 
downloaded at once (in jigdo-lite), like in using a space- or comma- 
seperated list.

If this makes sense to you, please let me know so that I can dust off my 
programmer manuals and start making the changes hopefully resulting in a 
nice diff for you to apply.

[...snip...]
&gt;<i> The way this was envisioned by me for the jigdo GUI client (and it's 
</I>&gt;<i> already implemented there!) was to have people add an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;[Include <A HREF="http://example.org/mirrormgr.php">http://example.org/mirrormgr.php</A>]&quot; line inside the .jigdo file. 
</I>&gt;<i> The server-side PHP script would then output a mirror list with 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriately weighted mirrors. Based on a scoring algorithm, jigdo would 
</I>&gt;<i> then try the suggested mirrors first, but fall back to less appropriate 
</I>&gt;<i> ones for multiple parallel downloads or if a file was not found. A mirror's 
</I>&gt;<i> overall score was planned to decrease if it was too slow or there were too 
</I>&gt;<i> many 404s.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Presumably we could already make full use of this or similar eliminating 
any need for the above mentioned mirrorlist/server, if only we could 
specify a label for the include -which is primarily of concern when 
having multiple images in one .jigdo. Besides, Fedora MirrorManager 
doesn't have 'weighted' mirrors.

&gt;<i> jigdo-lite doesn't support this, you'd have to create the .jigdo files 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically using PHP. :-/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The Jigdo GUI client. Well, we could certainly help out here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be awesome!!! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> My estimate is that the GUI client is about 80% done. Unfortunately, other 
</I>&gt;<i> things in life caused me to abandon work on this quite a while ago, and I 
</I>&gt;<i> definitely won't have any time to work on it in the next months. :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code should be in fairly good shape; it is well-documented, the UI 
</I>&gt;<i> parts are cleanly separated from the application logic etc. OTOH, the 
</I>&gt;<i> different C++ classes are also fairly complex, I may have been carried away 
</I>&gt;<i> a bit trying to write a generic, extensible application. Anyone who starts 
</I>&gt;<i> work on it (including me) will need a while to find their way around.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As do I (have been browsing the code for a while now looking for the 
best way to change anything so that I can see the effects and learn what 
it is the code does exactly) ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Other then these issues which we expect might be relevant to big 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> releases such as official Fedora Project Releases, let me tell you that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Fedora Unity (again, not the same ;p), has successfully released a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of custom spins via Jigdo[3], and is very, very satisfied with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the results ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great, thanks! :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thank you,

Kind regards,
