<PRE>Hello Jeroen,

thanks for your interest in using jigdo for Fedora (Unity)!

The bad news first: I have very little spare time these days, so I'm afraid 
that for any major changes, someone else would have to pick up jigdo 
development. I'll be happy to help you in any way I can, though - e.g. 
officially transferring maintenance of the code to an interested group of 
people would be very welcome!

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/JigdoRelease">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/JigdoRelease</A>
</I>
WRT the constraints mentioned:

* .jigdo files with multiple images: For some reason, the thought that one 
.jigdo file corresponds to one image appears to be firmly planted in 
people's minds. That made me &quot;deprecate&quot; the multi-image format while 
writing the jigdo GUI client. (The &quot;include&quot; functionality supported by the 
GUI app can be used to avoid duplicate content in related .jigdo files.) 
But I don't have a strong opinion on this...

* Parallel downloads: Were planned for the GUI client. Doing this in the 
shell script is definitely not something I would like to do. I've found out 
that using shell scripting for any non-trivial program is a bad idea. IMHO 
the current jigdo-lite code has reached the maximum possible complexity 
where it is still maintainable - pull a little at any end now and something 
will fall over at another end. :-/

* Manually adding [Servers] section: Yes - the idea is that any non-trivial 
additions to the .jigdo file should be done by a script after running 
jigdo-file, jigdo-file cannot support direct generation of all possible 
server/mirror setups.

&gt;<i> - We found that Jigdo currently is unable to thread a number of requests 
</I>&gt;<i> in parallel so that it -if it did- makes optimal use of the available 
</I>&gt;<i> resources in case the bandwidth availability between the client and a 
</I>&gt;<i> mirror is sufficient; as many files are actually small files currently 
</I>&gt;<i> we find that obtaining the files one after another takes rather long. We 
</I>&gt;<i> would love to investigate how we could optimize this by threading.
</I>
The correct way to make full use of the bandwidth is actually to use HTTP 
persistent connections and HTTP pipelining. This is supported by libcurl, 
which the jigdo GUI uses. It is more efficient for the server than 
individual parallel requests. The HTTP standard even strongly recommends 
that applications not open more than 2 concurrent TCP connections to any 
host.

For the Debian mirrors, some mirror maintainers were actually concerned 
that the many seeks caused by a jigdo download will decrease overall 
performance. Multiple connections per client might turn this into even more 
of a problem. But multiple connections to *different* mirrors are no 
problem!

(BTW, a completely different approach to solving the problem is to let 
image generation happen on the fly on the server; see &quot;CGI-like program for 
on-the-fly creation from .jigdo/.template files&quot; in 
&lt;<A HREF="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jigdo/jigdo/doc/Hacking.txt?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jigdo/jigdo/doc/Hacking.txt?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup</A>&gt;)

&gt;<i> - While the Fedora Project uses &quot;MirrorManager&quot; to direct clients to a 
</I>&gt;<i> (list of) local mirrors, we would like Jigdo to be able to 'cache' the 
</I>&gt;<i> mirror list returned by MirrorManager and use these mirrors constantly, 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of hitting the mirrorlist for each request (e.g. each file). Not 
</I>&gt;<i> being able to do so, we fear, results in overloading MirrorManager as per 
</I>&gt;<i> ISO image, approximately 4000 requests would have to be made.
</I>
The way this was envisioned by me for the jigdo GUI client (and it's 
already implemented there!) was to have people add an
&quot;[Include <A HREF="http://example.org/mirrormgr.php">http://example.org/mirrormgr.php</A>]&quot; line inside the .jigdo file. 
The server-side PHP script would then output a mirror list with 
appropriately weighted mirrors. Based on a scoring algorithm, jigdo would 
then try the suggested mirrors first, but fall back to less appropriate 
ones for multiple parallel downloads or if a file was not found. A mirror's 
overall score was planned to decrease if it was too slow or there were too 
many 404s.

jigdo-lite doesn't support this, you'd have to create the .jigdo files 
dynamically using PHP. :-/

&gt;<i> - The Jigdo GUI client. Well, we could certainly help out here.
</I>
That would be awesome!!! :-)
My estimate is that the GUI client is about 80% done. Unfortunately, other 
things in life caused me to abandon work on this quite a while ago, and I 
definitely won't have any time to work on it in the next months. :-(

The code should be in fairly good shape; it is well-documented, the UI 
parts are cleanly separated from the application logic etc. OTOH, the 
different C++ classes are also fairly complex, I may have been carried away 
a bit trying to write a generic, extensible application. Anyone who starts 
work on it (including me) will need a while to find their way around.

&gt;<i> Other then these issues which we expect might be relevant to big 
</I>&gt;<i> releases such as official Fedora Project Releases, let me tell you that 
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora Unity (again, not the same ;p), has successfully released a 
</I>&gt;<i> number of custom spins via Jigdo[3], and is very, very satisfied with 
</I>&gt;<i> the results ;-)
</I>
Great, thanks! :)

Cheers,

  Richard
